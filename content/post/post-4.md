Satoru Takizawa, Art Director, has said "When I was in elementary school, I read an art book that contained a collection of design materials, got really excited, and decided to do work where I could create things... If this book could have that sort of significance for someone else, I'd be thrilled." With that said, it was true when I first opened up the pages, I felt suddenly inspired and motivated to do things that I'm passionate about just like all of these artist in the book.</p>
