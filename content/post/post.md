Well, <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/social-media">social media</a> is defined as websites and applications that are designed to allow people to share content quickly, efficiently, and in real-time. (Hudson, 2019) Examples such as <a href="https://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>, or <a href="https://www.instagram.com/">Instagram</a> helps connect people in a global scale, no matter where you are, as long as you have the equipment to access SNS. But we must keep in mind that you have the ‚Äúultimate right and responsibility to control who has access to certain pieces of it, and when, and to protect it from abuse to the best of your ability‚Äù (Olshansky, 2016).</p><p>‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have a choice on whether we do social media, the choice is how well we do it.‚Äù As quoted by Erik Qualman. I agree to this because it all comes down to how you construct and behave yourself online to different audiences, just like celebrities who must be careful of what they say and how you look in front of the cameras. We continue to live in a fast-paced, digital world where we can gain and share information, to entertain or be entertained, to conduct business transactions, to procrastinate, and to form and develop <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/platonic%20love">platonic</a>/<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/romantic">romantic</a> relationships (Brown, 2016).</p><p>‚ÄúMaking judgements about the use of social media is fine, but when studying its application in human lives, we must move past these judgements on order to develop a full and critical understanding of the issues involved‚Äù (Brown, 2016). ¬†Brown reminded me how we must not lose sight of knowing who the person really is behind the screen. We shouldn‚Äôt make judgments of a person based on a post, because we do not know the his/her/their life behind the screen.</p><p>I am immensely reliant on social media to communicate with my family, friends, and classmates, especially when I‚Äôm living abroad and my family worries plenty for me. But it is different when I am doing something important such as assessments, unless it‚Äôs a group work that needs communication online.</p><p>Since I desire to work as a technical artist or programmer in creative and entertainment industries such as <a href="https://www.disneyanimation.com/">Disney</a> or <a href="https://www.dreamworks.com/">DreamWorks</a>, it is important to execute self-promotion efficiently because companies are expanding their horizons on hiring online through social media such as <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.artstation.com/">ArtStation</a>, or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/">LinkedIn</a>. One example is <a href="https://www.luludraws.com/">Price</a>, she got a job at Disney because of her connections and works in Tumblr.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card kg-card-hascaption"><iframe title="MY ART JOURNEY / HOW I GOT A JOB AT DISNEY" width="1170" height="658" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tlxh4zWoc3w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" style="box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 100%;"></iframe><figcaption>Figure 1.
