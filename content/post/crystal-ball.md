  Week 6 was all about LCS Screens & Tilt Switches instead of Touch board &

  Sensors because the materials, Bare Conductive Touch boards, ordered by Simone

  has not yet arrived, so hopefully we would do the remaining tasks on Week 9. 


  It was the most gruesome project when dealing with the wirings, but I jumped
  in

  joy and gladness when it worked and when I overcame that challenge especially

  when my board surprisingly looked neat and functional as much as possible! 


  This Arduino project took 1 hour

<p>Week 6 was all about LCS Screens &amp; Tilt Switches instead of Touch board &amp; Sensors because the materials, Bare Conductive Touch boards, ordered by Simone has not yet arrived, so hopefully we would do the remaining tasks on Week 9. </p><p>It was the most gruesome project <em>when</em> dealing with the wirings, but I jumped in joy and gladness when it worked and when I overcame that challenge especially when my board surprisingly looked neat and functional as much as possible! </p><p>This Arduino project took 1 hour and 10 minutes to complete, including troubleshooting. The major troubleshooting done was on the miswiring, one was on the wire of the resistor and potentiometer, where its one end was on A9 instead of B9 of the breadboard. While the other one was a solution from Simone, where wire connecting the potentiometer to the LCD screen is at the wrong slot, from B10 (dictated from the Arduino book) to G10. </p><p>The main ingredients for this project are: LCD screen display, tilt sensor, potentiometer, 10 kilohm resistor, and 220 ohm resistor. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://res-1.cloudinary.com/hizgjp0fn/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/20210331_133000_cropped.jpg" class="kg-image"><figcaption>Main ingredients (and lots of jumper wires) for Crystal Ball project</figcaption></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://res-4.cloudinary.com/hizgjp0fn/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/20210331_141636.jpg" width="4032" height="2268"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://res-4.cloudinary.com/hizgjp0fn/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/20210331_141640.jpg" width="4032" height="2268"></div></div><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://res-4.cloudinary.com/hizgjp0fn/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/20210331_141649.jpg" width="4032" height="2268"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://res-5.cloudinary.com/hizgjp0fn/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/20210331_141655.jpg" width="4032" height="2268"></div></div></div><figcaption>Pretty happy with how organised the jumper wires look - like a rainbow!</figcaption></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/532774951?app_id=122963" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen title="LCD Screens &amp;amp; Tilt Motion"></iframe></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://res-4.cloudinary.com/hizgjp0fn/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/Desn3600.png" class="kg-image"><figcaption>Figure 1.

Â Haven't been working much on my website (apdv) aside from the fact that I just had to add some &lt;head&gt; and &lt;title&gt; to name the tab when going to different pages. </p>
