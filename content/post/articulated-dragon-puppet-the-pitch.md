  Week 9 - May 5th


  National Innovation Games at the City Hall of NewcastleThis was the busiest
  day

  yet for me because I had to be at the National Innovation Games: Inclusion 365

  Hackathon by the City of Newcastle and Paddl Co. for almost 12 hours from 8 am

  to 7:30 pm. Thankfully, it is located at the City Hall (5 minutes walk) and
  the

  facilitators gave me 25 minutes to do my presentation! My first hackathon was

  worth it because our team won 1st place!


  Zoom Call with the team! <3On the day before

The feedback we got from our class was great! Although we have to be careful because of time constraints and the scope of the project may not be done. We rest assured that it is just the ‘blue sky’ level of our concept and we do not have to fulfill each of our numerous interactions, depending on time. I was not able to stay for long during lab time, so I just communicated through Slack to keep myself updated with Estelle and Aaron.</p>
