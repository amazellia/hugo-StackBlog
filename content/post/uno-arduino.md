Its expensive to ship things from a country that is 14 hours flight away from here. Thus, I am glad that I do not have to spend another $160 dollars on getting Arduino.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://res-2.cloudinary.com/hizgjp0fn/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/20210317_121508.jpg" class="kg-image"><figcaption>Unboxing a new Arduino UNO! Feeling enthusiastic on touching physical computing!</figcaption></figure><p>During the lab, I was able to learn about Arduino, its components, Ohm's Law and IDE! Then, did practical tasks on how a basic, parallel, and series circuits worked. Finally, we built a Love-o-meter that uses a temperature sensor and lights up LEDs depending on the heat - All in 2 hours! </p><p>I have learned that it is always best to follow the manual first, especially when you are a beginner. I always have to keep track on which number and letter should a component go in the breadboard or knowing the temperature sensor's flat orientation should be facing. The basic circuit took me 6-8 minutes to get a hang of, series circuit is 5 minutes, 7 mins for the parallel circuit, then lastly is 20 mins for the love-o-meter! </p><p>I have also noticed how the blue LEDs are much more vibrant than the red and green ones from the Arduino box, is there a reason for that? So I searched it up and discovered it depends on my resistor, apparently <a href="https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/26745/why-are-blue-leds-glowing-brighter-than-green-and-yellow-leds">[1]</a>. So next time I want to use different colors, I will have to check on the resistors that it needs in order to make it work. </p><p>Helping others in building the circuits in Arduino is fulfilling! I'm proud to see Estelle getting a hang of the parallel circuits, taught her on following the numbers and letters placed on the breadboard and explained the reason behind the wirings in a way.</p><p>The picture below are shots from my builds, including a diagram from the Arduino book:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://res-4.cloudinary.com/hizgjp0fn/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/image_2021-03-21_224924.png" width="575" height="648"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://res-4.cloudinary.com/hizgjp0fn/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/basic-cuircuit-diagram.png" width="686" height="526"></div></div></div><figcaption>Basic Circuit</figcaption></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://res-4.cloudinary.com/hizgjp0fn/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/image_2021-03-21_225020.png" width="579" height="580"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://res-1.cloudinary.com/hizgjp0fn/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/series-circuit-basics.png" width="817" height="482"></div></div></div><figcaption>Series circuit</figcaption></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://res-4.cloudinary.com/hizgjp0fn/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/image_2021-03-21_225138.png" width="572" height="687"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://res-1.cloudinary.com/hizgjp0fn/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/parallel-circuit-diagram.png" width="835" height="481"></div></div></div><figcaption>Parallel circuit</figcaption></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://res-1.cloudinary.com/hizgjp0fn/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/image_2021-03-21_225238.png" width="611" height="670"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://res-2.cloudinary.com/hizgjp0fn/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/love-o-meter-diagram.png" width="814" height="500"></div></div></div><figcaption>Love-o-meter project</figcaption></figure><hr><p>And on the other hand, I have been tinkering on how to fix my blog's display of images, because there are some gallery of images that have been stretched by some weird code as seen in Figure 1.
