<p>An interactive poster is a focus for week 8, while week 7 was a lecture about playful interactions and designs, where we learned about the definition of playful UI, gamification vs. playful design, differences between UX &amp; UI, types of screen-based UI and embodied interaction. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://res-4.cloudinary.com/hizgjp0fn/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/USER_SCOPED_TEMP_DATA_MSGR_PHOTO_FOR_UPLOAD_1619536734465_6792829403517409900.jpg" class="kg-image"></figure><p>I went shopping with Estelle for the crocodile clips in Jaycar and speakers in Kmart. Did not want to buy a touch board cause I am living on a budget. So, I have prepared twelve conductive ink paintings of different animals and game characters with their sound effects for the lab. The paintings include a frog, dog, cat, bear, camel, horse, Jigglypuff and Pikachu from Pokémon, Navi from Legend of Zelda, Princess Peach from Mario, Kirby, and Creeper from Minecraft.</p><p>This is the first time an experiment did not work for me because Aaron, Simone, and I have been trying to fix the Bare Conductive touch board for the entire 2-hour lab. Thankfully, it's not broken but just needs some time off, just like humans! It had something to do with the static that may have disrupted the components within the touch board. We are relieved that we did not break anything permanently.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://res-3.cloudinary.com/hizgjp0fn/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/20210428_122846.jpg" class="kg-image"></figure><p>Even though I am saddened that I could not use my paintings, it’s alright because we tried our best and that is a part of the experimentation! My idea was to make it interactive by guessing which subject in the painting makes their sound by playing around with the crocodile clips – just like a guessing game. You can even have it by letting Pikachu produce a Creeper sound! Not everything should be a success because failure is what makes us grow stronger.</p>
