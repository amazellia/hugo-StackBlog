It‚Äôs not what you watch, not what you hear, not what you read‚Ä¶ it is composed of the meaningful actions that the user takes while interacting with the work‚Äù (Bjarnason, 2014). The concept of interactivity isn‚Äôt new; in 1924, the US secretary of Commerce, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Hoover">Herbert Hoover</a>, praised the use of radio to ‚Äúcommunicate simultaneously with millions of our fellowmen, to furnish entertainment, instruction, widening vision of national problems and national events‚Äù (Lappin).</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://soci.newcastle.edu.au/amandaviray/wp-content/uploads/sites/941/2020/01/President_Hoover_portrait-769x1024.jpg" class="kg-image"><figcaption><em style="box-sizing: border-box; font-style: italic;">Figure 1.

With interactivity, the outcomes are virtual communities, confirmation bias, social disengagement, network individualism, memes and viral culture.</p><p>Virtual communities are the social collections that came from the [internet] when people discussions similar things, with emotions, to form personal relationships in the digital space (Siapera E. , 2018). Next is the confirmation bias, it occurs when individuals look for evidences and information that supports only their beliefs or views, and whatever information is against their views will be ignored (Spencer &amp; Heneghan, 2018).</p><p>But I don‚Äôt believe that interactivity makes us totally socially disengaged with our physical world, because it truly depends on how the person use their devices. Some people, like me, can engage in the digital space, while still being socially active in the physical world. It all comes down to how efficient they manage their time. Network individualism means we can choose where we are, and we can also choose who we socialize with, sadly, this doesn‚Äôt account for the people who‚Äôre digitally illiterate or those who needs to frequently manage their networks. Lastly, memes and viral culture are ‚Äúimitation‚Äù (Dawkins, 1976). They are a rapid spread of ideas, images, videos, etc. though the internet.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card kg-card-hascaption"><iframe title="TikTok Memes to make your day better üòå" width="1170" height="658" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nJmK65qikk4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" style="box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 100%;"></iframe><figcaption>Video.

Depressingly, despite the accusations for his plundering back when he was a Senator in 2012, Filipinos still voted for his video, and won the recent election as Senator. There isn‚Äôt much to do as being a programmer, but because I have the skills to create and spread content, I hope to educate my people to not let the fanservice of politics affect their voting decision thorough blogs and applications.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card kg-card-hascaption"><iframe title="Sen.
