It’s just a matter of managing our time well.</p><p>Hilariously, before the class ended, Simone was worried about the lithium battery Aaron has and Estelle proclaimed "Nahh, its pretty safe!", then proceeds to place the battery to the aluminum foil. Then, it started sparking up!</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://res-1.cloudinary.com/hizgjp0fn/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/184210517_823599664927043_5361914584995704390_n.jpg" class="kg-image"></figure><p>It gave everyone a heart attack because of the smoke and sparks it produced! Thankfully, Estelle immediately removed it from the foil - it was a close call and no one got hurt. Our entire class would even get brownie points for this 'near-misses', hahaha.  </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://res-4.cloudinary.com/hizgjp0fn/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/image_2021-05-17_220246.png" class="kg-image"></figure>
