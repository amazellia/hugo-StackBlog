People may mention their <a href="https://www.ancient.eu/religion/">religion</a>, <a href="https://genderedinnovations.stanford.edu/terms/race.html">ethnicity</a>, <a href="https://www.open.edu/openlearn/society-politics-law/what-politics/content-section-2.1">politics</a>, <a href="https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/Sexuality-explained">sexuality</a>, or their <a href="https://nobaproject.com/modules/personality-traits">personal traits</a>. There are three ways to define identity: subjectivity (how we think of ourselves), representation (how different facets of identity are depicted in culture and media); or self-presentation (how we present ourselves to others). Personal identity refers as an individual, while social identity as a member of a group (Marwick, 2013).</p><p>There are a various theories on identity and how they are based, the five main ones are: static, meaning it is singular, fixed, and unchanging throughout a lifetime or an essential personality that remains constant, for example, race, class, and gender; context (where they are) and audiences (who they’re with); ‘race’ and ‘gender’; mass media and consumer goods; or project, something that can be actively worked on (Marwick, 2013). However, postmodern researchers have focused on identity as a text or discourse than <a href="https://psychology.iresearchnet.com/counseling-psychology/personality-assessment/behavioral-observation-methods/">behavioral observations</a>, and we must “approach identity as a source of mobilization rather than a product of it” (Altheide, 2011).</p><p>Identity online is also the “authoring of self as a living-out of these states of being, becoming, belonging, and behaving through a range of everyday social and discursive practices that are connected with the body. Yet it is also about a close editing of self, ‘it’s me, but minus the things I don’t like about me’” (Thomas, 2007). The construction of identity is through <a href="https://sproutsocial.com/insights/social-media-branding/">customization</a>, personalizing profiles signal status, and cultural affiliation (Marwick, 2013).</p><p>There is a difficulty in the maintenance of online identity, which results to “<a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcmc/article/23/3/127/4962540">context collapse</a>”. It is a concept of “flattening out of multiple distinct audiences in one’s social network, such that people from different contexts become part of a singular group of message recipients” (Vitak, 2012). In return, people created various techniques in handling context collapse, such as producing multiple accounts for specific audiences. Like myself, who has one account for <a href="https://twitter.com/_apdv">family and friends</a> and another for <a href="https://twitter.com/amazellia">artworks</a>.</p><p>As an aspiring <a href="https://learn.org/articles/What_Does_a_Video_Game_Programmer_Do.html">video game programmer</a>, it’s essential to have my own identity, especially having a reputable online presence to gain large base of ‘followers’ which is an edge for getting recruited. My favorite example is <a href="https://twitter.com/zephybite?s=20">Angela He,</a> not because of her massive audiences, but it’s because of her ability to maintain professionalism, yet giving behind-the-scenes of her <a href="https://zephyo.github.io/">works</a>, which draws the audience in to know more about her.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://soci.newcastle.edu.au/amandaviray/wp-content/uploads/sites/941/2020/01/Picture1-1.png" class="kg-image"><figcaption><em style="box-sizing: border-box; font-style: italic;">Figure 1.
