These few examples are ‚Äúthe set of rules or customs that control accepted behavior in particular social groups or social situations,‚Äù called etiquette (Cambridge Dictionary, n.d.). Same goes with the meaning of netiquette, the only difference is it is based on the digital or online situation (Jacob, 2019), but the customs are similar, no matter if you‚Äôre in the physical world or not. But how can we achieve netiquettes? We must first know and understand the meaning and difference between morality and ethics, ‚Äòdo we need to develop digital ethics?‚Äô, site examples of morally/ethically questionable digital content, and how is this related with profession.</p><p>Morality is the ‚Äúability to understand the difference between right and wrong‚Äù (Straubhaar, LaRose, &amp; Davenport, 2016, p. 505). While ethics, ‚Äúare standards of good conduct and moral rules in all situations whether or not they are governed by formal laws or policies‚Äù (ibid). Though both of these concepts are closely related, ‚Äúmorals refer mainly to guiding principles, and ethics refer to specific rules and actions, or behaviors‚Äù (Dictionary.com). You must always remember that what is ethical isn‚Äôt always what is moral, and vice versa.</p><p>‚ÄúDo we need to develop digital ethics or should we muddle through?‚Äù In developing digital ethics, ‚Äúincreased vulnerability requires increased responsibility‚Äù as individuals (Ess, p. 13), in contrast to the argument of ‚Äòmuddle through‚Äô, which means learning more from our experiences than from careful reflection; ‚Äúwe will simply learn from our mistakes‚Äù (Ess, p. 14). But because our interactions nowadays are based on how we respond via digital media and networks, our ethical responsibility should be understood as ‚Äúdistributed responsibility‚Äù (Ess, p. 21), means the ‚Äúability to recognize, interpret and act upon multiple principles and values according to the standards within a given field and/or context‚Äù (Suny Empire State College). Thankfully, this understanding has been already shared with multiple philosophies and religions around the world.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://soci.newcastle.edu.au/amandaviray/wp-content/uploads/sites/941/2020/01/99431996_loganpaul-1.jpg" class="kg-image"><figcaption><em style="box-sizing: border-box; font-style: italic;">Figure 1.
